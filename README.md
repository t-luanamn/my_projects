# 42 Adelaide Projects

This repository contains solutions to several foundational programming projects from the 42 curriculum. Each project focuses on a different aspect of computer science, including C programming, algorithms, data structures, system programming, graphics, and C++.

## Projects Overview

- **M_00_libft**: Custom implementation of standard `C library` functions.
- **M_01_ft_printf**: Reimplementation of the `printf` function in `C`.
- **M_01_get_next_line**: Function to read a single line from a file descriptor.
- **M_02_fractol**: Graphical program to generate and display fractals using MiniLibX.
- **M_02_pipex**: Recreation of shell pipe behavior, handling multiple processes and pipes.
- **M_02_push_swap**: Sorting algorithm project to sort integers with the least number of moves.
- **M_03_minishell**: A miniature shell program supporting basic shell features.
- **M_03_philosophers**: Solution to the dining philosophers problem using threads, mutexes, and semaphores.
- **M_04_cpp**: Series of small `C++` programs exploring Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- **M_04_MiniRT**: A simple ray-tracing program for rendering 3D scenes.
- **M_05_ft_irc**: IRC chat server implementation in `C++`.
- **M_05_inception**: `Docker-based` project setting up a network with containers for `nginx`, `MariaDB`, and `WordPress`.

## Getting Started

To build and run a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` or `Makefile`. Example:

```sh
cd M_00_libft
make
```
